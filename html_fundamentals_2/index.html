    <p style="font-size: 12px; line-height: 150%;">I am an aspiring web developer. In my previous life I was a mainframe programmer, a librarian and some other things. I enjoy hanging out with my pet parrots, and reading novels and non-fiction on various topics. My goal is to be a happy productive developer and work in an organization where I can
        both be a learner and a teacher. My favorite thing about this career is that it makes my brain work hard every day!</p>

    <!--This is the experience section-->
    <h1 style="border-style: solid solid none solid; border-color: red;">Experience</h1>
    <p style="font-family: Arial; background-color: lightgray; border-style: none dashed dashed dashed; border-color: black;">My previous job was as a web developer in a non-profit think tank. Mostly I supported an outside design firm in enhancing my organization's website. This required a lot of SQL, knowledge of the Sitecore CMS and some knowledge of C#/asp.net. My responsibilities included assisting with the data migration from the old site, testing, and migrating code to the staging and live sites.</p>
