    <p>Don't you see how great this is? You, you are a... Jesse look at me. You... are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about
        it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't
        he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay?</p>
    <p>
        The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him
        intimidating, that's why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's you! You are a
        blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the
        blowfish, Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a
        BLOWFISH! </p>
